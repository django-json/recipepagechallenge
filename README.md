## Overview

![recipepagescreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44185999/94666658-53950f00-0340-11eb-8234-2cf88de0c711.png)

- Check the demo [here](https://recipepagechallenge.netlify.app).
- My experience for this project is fair. Using CSS pseudo-element such as :before is fun. But I still have some issues about the best way to use BEM because this is my first time to use it and it gave me headeache because of my English vocabulary as I need to name most elements for their own class names. BEM is good especially when you restructure your html codes but I thought it looked messy as there were so much long class names. Haha.
- I practiced my responsive web design skills and some tricky CSS like using of pseudo-element as I am not used to it.
- Just enjoy what you are doing. If you feel you are going to have vertigo, just take a break. Do not rush because this challenge is meant for fun, not a burden. Lol.
